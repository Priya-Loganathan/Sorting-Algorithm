# Selection sort and Insertion sort
## Aim:
To write a program to perform selection sort and insertion sort using python programming.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
## Selection Sort Algorithm:
1.	Set the first unsorted element as the minimum
2.	For each of the unsorted elements, check if the element < current minimum.
3.	If yes, set the element as the new minimum.
4.	Swap minimum with first unsorted position.
5.	Repeat the steps 2 and 3 for all the elements in the array.
## Insertion Sort Algorithm:
1.	Set the first element as sorted element j.
2.	For each unsorted element X, check if current sorted element j >X.
3.	If yes, move sorted element to the right by 1.
4.	Break the loop and insert X.
5.	Repeat the steps 2 to 4 for sorting all the elements in the array.
## Program:
i)	#Selection Sort
```





```
ii)	#Insertion Sort
```






```

## Output:
